# Hello-world

uh... hello?

made this account a bit ago, decided to log back into it since i started messing around in librecad recently.

might work on designing my own flex cut pcb for o-ring boards since i think it might be a bit fun to learn during the summer.

as a bit about me:
i listen to music frequently, but it's usually just lofi or "relatively calm" breakcore,
i play the clarinet, but kind of suck at it,
obsess about keyboards actively on GeekHack as "granola bar enthusiast",
and recently quit osu! as a whole.

thanks for reading!
